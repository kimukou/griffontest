<body>
This package contains an annotation and its processor to be used with AspectJ in order to send alarms in case of exceptions, in any method or class.

Usage is really simple: just annotate any method where you want an alarm to be sent in case of an uncaught exception, and then setup the AlarmAspect in your app so that annotated methods will be intercepted.
